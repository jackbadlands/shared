I would like to publish this code under MIT or Public_Domain, but I'm not sure about author's license, is it permit that or not.

If you have found it could be used under MIT or Public_Domain (or you don't care), use it under MIT or Public_Domain.

In other case concact author of original code of "suncalc" (original "suncalc" was in JS) to clear details.
his "suncalc" git repository is:
https://github.com/mourner/suncalc
